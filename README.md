# Ciel
Ciel is an intuitive **image tagging** application built with Electron.

It helps you effortlessly organize and manage your image collection through a flexible tagging system. With Ciel, you can quickly find, categorize, and keep track of all your images in one convenient place.
## Adding images
The application has no images when installed for the first time, so let's add some!

First, click the *Upload* icon:

Inside an upload page you can upload any number of images you want. You can do it by either clicking the *Add* button, dropping the images or pasting them.

The image doesn't even need to be previosly downloaded in your computer, just drop or paste it and Ciel will do download it for you! (Be sure you are trying to upload a proper image and not the link of a page)
